# Logistic Regression Model using TensorFlow

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Logistic Regression model** built with **TensorFlow**. Logistic Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm widely used for **binary classification problems** such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and sentiment analysis.

The notebook walks through:

* Data preprocessing
* Building the Logistic Regression model using TensorFlow
* Training & evaluation
* Visualizing results

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Features

* Implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using TensorFlow
* Training pipeline with loss calculation & gradient updates
* Performance evaluation using metrics like **accuracy** and **loss curves**
* Easy-to-understand, beginner-friendly code
